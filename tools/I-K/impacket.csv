Impacket is focused on providing low-level programmatic access to the packets and for some protocols (e.g. SMB1-3 and MSRPC) the protocol implementation itself. Packets can be constructed from scratch. as well as parsed from raw data. and the object oriented API makes it simple to work with deep hierarchies of protocols. The library provides a set of tools as examples of what can be done within the context of this library.","T1557.001 - T1040 - T1003.001 - T1003.002 - T1003.003 - T1003.004 - T1558.003 - T1569.002 - T1047","TA0001 - TA0003 - TA0004 - TA0005 - TA0006 - TA0008 - TA0011","N/A","Akira - Bassterlord* - BianLian - Dragonfly - FIN8 - HAFNIUM - Hive - LockBit - Magic Hound - RansomHub - Rhysida - Sandworm Team - Scattered Spider* - Threat Group-3390 - Yanluowang - menuPass - Volt Typhoon - Cinnamon Tempest - Magic Hound - DAGGER PANDA - ENERGETIC BEAR - DEV-0270 - COZY BEAR - FANCY BEAR  - EMBER BEAR - BERSERK BEAR - Dispossessor - Black Basta","Lateral Movement","https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket","1","0","N/A","N/A","10","10","14198","3681","2025-04-22T13:40:55Z","2015-04-15T14:04:07Z","48251"
